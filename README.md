# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

An online shoe store wants to segment its customers and develop marketing strategies based on these segments. To do this, customer behavior will be defined and groups will be created based on the clustering of these behaviors. The dataset used in this project consists of information obtained from the past shopping behaviors of customers who made OmniChannel (both online and offline) purchases at an online shoe store during the years 2020 - 2021.


What is RFM analysis?


RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a technique used in customer relationship management (CRM) for customer segmentation.

The RFM analysis process typically involves analyzing customer data to determine three metrics:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase recently are considered more valuable than those who have not made a purchase in a long time.

Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase. Customers who make frequent purchases are considered more valuable than those who make infrequent purchases.

Monetary: How much money a customer spends. Customers who spend more money are considered more valuable than those who spend less.
